## Data Preprocessing
* Cleaning: Handled missing values and outliers.
* Normalize pattern: Used Regex to filter values
* Feature Engineering: Used RandomOverSampler to make a balance-data

## Setup
- Requirement: Ensure you have Python 3 and required libraries installed (pandas, numpy, sklearn, imblearn).
- Installation:
  * Pandas
  ```sh
  pip install pandas
  ```
   * Odf (It supports to read an excel file):
  ```sh
  pip install odfpy
  ```
  There are similar to numpy, scikit-learn and imblearn to install
  
## Model

I used **RandomizedSearchCV** for training the model to find the best results. I handled the text data using **TfidfVectorizer** and **OneHotEncoder**.


## Result:
* Accuracy: 0.71
* Precision: 0.63(macro avg), 0.70(weighted avg).
* Recall: 0.45(macro avg), 0.71(weighted avg).
* F1-score: 0.50(macro avg), 0.70(weighted avg).
